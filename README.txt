-------------------------------
BB84 Monogamy Game:
-------------------------------
Computes the upper and lower bounds for the BB84 monogamy game [1]
using the techniques from [2].

--------------------------------------------------------
Mutually Unbiased Basis Monogamy Game: 
--------------------------------------------------------
Illustrates a monogamy game defined by a set of mutually unbiased bases
where the players benefit from using entanglement as described in [2]
