# NPAR
## Version 0.0.1 - 20 September 2015

NPAR is a set of MATLAB scripts that supplement the results of the article [2]. 

To run in MATLAB, add the ```/src/``` directory (including all sub-directories) to your current working directory.

## Dependencies
In order to run these scripts in MATLAB, you must also have CVX [3] and QETLAB [4] downloaded and added to your ```/src/``` directory. 

## Description

This set of scripts allows one to bound the classical, quantum, and non-signaling game values for monogamy of entanglement games.  

## Examples

### BB84 Monogamy Game

Running the script: ```examples/BB84MonogamyGame.m``` computes the upper and lower bounds for the BB84 monogamy game [1] using the techniques from [2].

### Mutually Unbiased Basis Monogamy Game

Running the script: ```examples/MUB_4_3_MonogamyGame.m``` illustrates a monogamy game defined by a set of mutually unbiased bases consisting of 4-inputs and 3-outputs 
where the players benefit from using entanglement as described in [2].
